<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Hello there! My name is Benjamin Hertzsch, I am a PhD candidate in
Cosmology &amp; Theoretical Physics at the <a
href="https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/">Higgs Centre for Theoretical
Physics</a> at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of
Edinburgh</a>, located in the picturesque capital of bonnie Scotland. On
these pages, you can find some information about me and my research.</p>
<p>I grew up in the charming Eastern German town of Zwickau, which is
best known today as the birthplace of composer Robert Schumann. After
undergraduate studies in <a
href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">Manchester</a>, I obtained my MSc
in Physics at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zurich</a>. During
my time in Switzerland, I specialised in gravitation, quantum fields and
cosmology, as well as mathematical and computational methods for modern
physics.</p>
<p>In 2023, I went to Edinburgh to start my PhD under the supervision of
<a href="https://jfeldbrugge.github.io">Dr Job Feldbrugge</a>. I
consider myself a cosmologist, focusing primarily on cosmic structure
formation through the lens of catastrophe theory. I am also interested
in related phenomena in other areas of theoretical physics. You can read
more about my research on <a href="./research.html">this page</a>.</p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy a cup of green tea, a game of chess, and I
like to explore the country either on hikes or on my motorcycle. I am
also an enthusiastic hobby guitarist, playing music by the likes of
Schumann, TÃ¡rrega, Villa-Lobos and Piazzolla.</p>
