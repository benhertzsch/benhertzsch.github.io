## Notes

On this page, I will post some short notes on scientific topics related to my research, which may be of interest to a broader audience.

- **[Catastrophe Theory â€” The Seven Elementary Catastrophes](./catastrophe_theory.html)**

  In these notes, I derive Thom's "seven elementary catastrophes" in the physicist's (rather than mathematician's) language. I discuss their characteristic geometries and show physical applications. Several modern visualisations are included.
