## About

Hello there! My name is Benjamin Hertzsch, I am a PhD candidate in Cosmology & Theoretical Physics at the [Higgs Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://higgs.ph.ed.ac.uk/) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), located in the picturesque capital of bonnie Scotland. On these pages, you can find some information about me and my research.

I grew up in the charming Eastern German town of Zwickau, which is best known today as the birthplace of composer Robert Schumann. 
After undergraduate studies in [Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/), I obtained my MSc in Physics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). During my time in Switzerland, I specialised in gravitation, quantum fields and cosmology, as well as mathematical and computational methods for modern physics.

In 2023, I went to Edinburgh to start my PhD under the supervision of [Dr Job Feldbrugge](https://jfeldbrugge.github.io). I consider myself a cosmologist, focusing primarily on cosmic structure formation through the lens of catastrophe theory. I am also interested in related phenomena in other areas of theoretical physics. You can read more about my research on [this page](./research.html).

In my free time, I enjoy a cup of green tea, a game of chess, and I like to explore the country either on hikes or on my motorcycle. I am also an enthusiastic hobby guitarist, playing music by the likes of Schumann, TÃ¡rrega, Villa-Lobos and Piazzolla.
