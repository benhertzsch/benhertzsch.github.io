<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> These notes were typed up as a
first version for a PhD seminar I gave in Edinburgh on the 27/02/2025.
These notes likely contain numerous typos, are wordy or inaccurate in
places, and the there are issues with varying screen sizes. I will
update the notes and fix the template soon.</p>
<p>In these notes, I will derive Thom’s <em>seven elementary
catastrophes</em> (<a
href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Stabilit%C3%A9_structurelle_et_morphog%C3%A9n%C3%A8s.html?id=t7Lbs7x5G9wC&amp;redir_esc=y">Thom
(1972)</a>), the main elements of catastrophe theory in the
four-dimensional universe. Key works on catastrophe theory are <a

(1972)</a> (amongst many of Arnol’d’s mathematical works on catastrophe
theory) as well as various articles by <a
href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Catastrophe_Theory.html?id=CxuYf2PP2hsC&amp;redir_esc=y">Zeeman
(1972-1977)</a>. An in-depth and mathematically rigorous survey of
catastrophe theory can be found in <a

href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-58124-3">Arnold

href="https://michaelberryphysics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/berry089-1.pdf">Berry
(1980)</a>. In the following, I will closely follow <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-catastrophe-theory/D5ECA839997CD9C2A247C413E69CD2B8">Saunders
(1980)</a> to derive catastrophe theory in the language familiar to
physicists.</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals-and-terminology">Fundamentals and terminology</h2>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Critical points and Morse’s lemma</span>
Consider a multivariate function <span
class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{x})\)</span> of some state variables
<span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. The function has a
critical point at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}_0\)</span>
if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\nabla \mathbf{x} \lvert_{\mathbf{x}_0} = 0
\]</span></p>
<p>The critical point is <em>non-degenerate</em> if the Hessian <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}f(\mathbf{x}) = \partial_i \partial_j
f(\mathbf{x})\)</span> at the critical point is invertible, i.e. if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\det(\mathcal{H}f(\mathbf{x})) \lvert_{\mathbf{x}_0}  \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\det(\mathcal{H}f(\mathbf{x}))
\lvert_{\mathbf{x}_0} = 0\)</span>, the critical point is
<em>degenerate</em>. In the one-dimensional case, <span
class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, it is customary to call the a
critical point <em><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fold
degnerate</em> for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> derivatives
higher than first-order vanishing at <span
class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Catastrophe theory is the general classification of
degenerate points and thus extends Morse’s classication of
non-degenerate critical points</strong>. In the following, critical
points will always taken to be at the origin <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}\)</span>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./notes/catastrophe_theory/figures/fig-min_max_Morse.jpeg" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 80%; max-width: 800px; padding: 5px;">
<figcaption>
The functions <span class="math inline">\(-x^2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> have a maximum / minimum respectively
as a non-degenerate critical point at the origin.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For a function <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> of a single
variable and a non-degenerate critical point at the origin, <em>Morse’s
classification</em> states that the critical point is a minimum if <span
class="math inline">\(f&#39;&#39;(0) &gt; 0\)</span> and a maximum if
<span class="math inline">\(f&#39;&#39;(0) &lt; 0\)</span>. This
classification extends to the multivariate case as follows: Consider a
multivariate function <span class="math inline">\(f(\mathbf{x})\)</span>
with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> state variables <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> and a non-degenerate critical
point at the origin. <em>Morse’s lemma</em> states that there exists a
diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> which
preservers the origin, <span class="math inline">\(\psi(\mathbf{0}) =
\mathbf{0}\)</span>, under which the function near the non-degenerate
critical point may be written in the quadratic form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(\psi(\mathbf{x})) = -x_1^2 - x_2^2 - \ldots - x_p^2+1 + x_{p+1}^2 +
\ldots + x_{n}^2 \,,
\]</span></p>
<p>One calls <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> the (Morse) index of
the singularity at <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}={0}\)</span>,
which counts the directions in which the function assumes a maximum.
Written in this quadratic form, it is obvious that the Hessian <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H}{f}\)</span> is invertible at a
non-degenerate critical point.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Corank</span> Degenerate critical points were
defined above by the condition <span class="math inline">\(\det
\mathcal{H} f(\mathbf{x}) = 0\)</span>. Consider now a frame in which
the Hessian is diagonal, so that diagonal second derivatives coincide
with the eigenvalues, of the product of which is equal to the
determinant. It is now a priori unclear how many of these eigenvalues
vanish, corresponding to the orthogonal directions in which the Hessian
is degenerate. The <em>splitting lemma</em> now states that to classify
all the non-degenerate critical points, one only has to consider the
<em>essential</em> variables, for which the vanishing of the second
derivate cannot be removed by a suitable coordinate transformation.
Their number is equal to the number of vanishing eigenvalues of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{H} f(\mathbf{x})\)</span>. One refers to
the number of essential variables as <em>corank</em> of the
singularity.</p>
<p>In the following, I will assume the number of state variables for a
function always to be equal to the number of essential variables, and
hence use the terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Structural stability</span> <em>Structural
stability</em> refers to the property of a function that the qualitative
nature of the function does not change under small perturbations.
Consider for example the polynomials in a single variable <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> up to some order <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Structural stability requires that the
addition of any polynomial <span class="math inline">\(\alpha
x^m\)</span> with small <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> a positive integer and does not
alter the critical nature of the function near the critical point
(i.e. the origin). For <span class="math inline">\(m&gt;n\)</span>, this
is trivially true; for <span class="math inline">\(m&lt;n\)</span>, the
situation may change.</p>

The function <span class="math inline">\(x^3 - \alpha x\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha = \{-0.15, 0.0, 0.15\}\)</span>.
Varying <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> from negative to
positive values unfolds the degenerate critical point at the origin to a
pair of non-degenerate critical points (maximum and minimum).
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Consider for instance the function <span class="math inline">\(f(x) =
x^3\)</span> which has a degenerate critical point at the origin. This
is function not structurally stable, as the addition of the term <span
class="math inline">\(-\alpha x\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(\alpha&gt;0\)</span> would change the function’s
qualitative nature by unfolding the critical point at the origin into a
maximum and a minimum at <span class="math inline">\(x = \{ \pm
\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{3}}\}\)</span>. However, the family of functions
<span class="math inline">\(f_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x}) = x^3 + u_2 x^2 +
u_1 x^1 + u_0\)</span> is structurally stable, as the addition of any
term <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> up to <span
class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span> does not change the critical
behaviour of the family of functions. The same argument applies to
multivariate functions with several state variables <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, where the function family
<span class="math inline">\(f_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x})\)</span> addition
of any small perturbation in <span class="math inline">\(\alpha
h(\mathbf{x})\)</span> with must be “recovered” in the function
family.</p>
<p>Throughout these notes, the subcript <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> will be generally omitted for
simplicity, and “families of functions” will be simply referred to as
“functions”. It should be clear from the context that parameters may be
involved.</p>
<p>At this point, note that we have been discussing polynomials only.
This is actually general, as we are interested in the neighborhood of a
critical point, where a function may be expanded in a Taylor series. The
results we derived are therefore to be understood as classifying the
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-<em>jet</em> <span
class="math inline">\(j^k(x)\)</span> (Taylor series truncated at order
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) of a generic analytic function
that can be locally expanded as a polynomial.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Unfoldings</span> The function families
discussed above are also called <em>unfoldings</em> of the
singularities. Consider again the bare singularity <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>, for which the unfolding</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f_{\mathbf{u}}(x) = x^n + u_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots + u_1 x + u_0
\]</span></p>
<p>provides a structurally stable family of functions. Similarly, for a
singularity in several state variables <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, a possible unfolding is
obtained by adding all monomials of lower order. For instance, for <span
class="math inline">\(x^3 y^2\)</span>, all terms <span
class="math inline">\(x^k y^l\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(k &lt;3 \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(l &lt; 2 \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> could appear in
this function family.</p>
<p>An unfolding is said to be <em>versal</em> if it is structurally
stable. Clearly, this is the case for the unfoldings proposed above.
However, not all terms in these function families are actually necessary
to ensure structural stability. For instance, for a singularity <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>, it is readily seen that the terms
<span class="math inline">\(u_{n-1} x^{n-1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(u_0\)</span> do not actually change qualitative
behavior of the function, as they may simply be absorbed in a shift of
the origin and do not change the critical point. For more than one state
variable, it is not so obvious which terms would be relevant, but the
same argument applies.</p>
<p>An unfolding is said to be <em>universal</em> if it is structurally
stable and has the least number of parameters. The term
<em>unfolding</em> in the literature usually refers to universal
unfolding of a caustic. In the univariate case, the singularity a <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span>-fold degenerate and takes <span
class="math inline">\(n-2\)</span> unfolding parameters:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f_{\mathbf{u}}(x) = x^n + u_{n-2} x^{n-2} + \ldots + u_1 x
\]</span></p>
<p>For singularities with two state variables, a few universal
unfoldings will be derived below. Throughout these notes, the essential
(state) variables will always be denoted as <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>, and the universal unfolding
parameteres as <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, consider again the singularity <span
class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span>, for which we can now write down the
universal unfolding as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = x^3 + u x
\]</span></p>
<p>It is now clear that the term “unfolding” is chosen because the
linear term reveals that the degenerate critical point actually is two
coincident non-degenerate critical points, which are unfolded by varying
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. Generally, universal unfoldings
unfold <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fold degenerate critical
points into <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> non-degenerate
critical points.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Codimension</span> The unfolding parameters
in physical applications of catastrophe theory represent a target space,
which is typically the (up to) <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>
dimensions of our space-time. This means that stable geometric objects
(rather than unstable transient events) in this target space can be
defined by up to <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span> constraint
equations. The number of constraint equations is typically called the
<span class="math inline">\(codimension\)</span> of an object.</p>
<p>For the following list of seven elementary catastrophes, it suffices
to define the codimension of a singularity as the number of parameters
in the universal unfolding. This is because, as we have already seen for
the univariate case <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span>, the
number of unfolding parameters is equal to a singularity’s degree of
degeneracy. But saying that a critical point is <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fold degenerate is the same as saying
that there <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> constraint equations,
which constrain <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> higher
derivatives to vanish.</p>
<p>For the case of more than one essential variable, the same argument
holds, and the codimension is again equal to the number of unfolding
parameters. We will see below that finding the universal unfoldings is
more tricky, but we can already make another important observation:
Consider a singularity of corank <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>,
with <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> state variables (all of
which are essential). The Hessian is symmetric, thus the vanishing of
<span class="math inline">\(\det \mathcal{H} f\)</span> requires that
all the <span class="math inline">\(l(l+1)/2\)</span> independent
entries of the Hessian are zero. This means that there are <span
class="math inline">\(l(l+1)/2\)</span> constraint equations, and the
singularity is therefore of codimension at least <span
class="math inline">\(l(l+1)/2\)</span>. In words, a corank-<span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> singularity is stabilised by at least
<span class="math inline">\(l(l+1)\)</span> unfolding parameters.
Corank-3 singularities therefore take at least 6 unfolding parameters,
and are not stable in the 4-dimensional universe; similarly for higher
corank.</p>
<p>The corollary of the above is the following:</p>
<div class="centered-box">
<p><strong>In the <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-dimensional
universe, the full classification of stable degenerate critical points
is given by the catastrophes of corank up to 2 and codimension up to
4.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Is is clear evident that the relevant corank-1 singularities are
<span class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span> through <span
class="math inline">\(x^6\)</span>. It will also be shown the that there
are three relevant corank-2 singularities.</p>
<div class="centered-box">
<p><strong>The seven elementary catastrophes are given by:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="math inline">\(x^3 \qquad x^4 \qquad x^5 \qquad

<p>These are called the <strong><em>fold</em></strong>,
<strong><em>cusp</em></strong>, <strong><em>swallowtail</em></strong>,
<strong><em>butterfly</em></strong> and the

and <strong><em>parabolic umbilic</em></strong>.</p>
</div>
<p>For completeness, note that our simplistic definition of codimension
ceases to be appropriate for catastrophes of higher-order catastrophes,
where moduli spaces occur and the geometric and algebraic dimensions of
the singularities become different.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Critical set, singular set and bifurcation

class="math inline">\((\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u})\)</span> of essential
variables <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> and unfolding
parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>. In this
space, there are a few objects of interest, which reveal the
characteristic geometries of the various caustics in physical
applications. The <em>equilibrium</em> or <em>critical set</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> is defined as the set of all
points for which the function’s gradient vanishes,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{M} = \{ \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u} : \nabla
f_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x}) = 0\} \,
\]</span></p>
<p>where the subscript <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>
is again omitted. The <em>singular set</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is defined as the set of all
points within the critical set for which the Hessian is
non-invertable,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S} = \{ \mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}  \in \mathcal{M}: \det
\mathcal{H} f_{\mathbf{u}}(\mathbf{x}) = 0\}
\]</span></p>
<p>Both <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> live in space of essential
variables and unfolding parameters <span
class="math inline">\((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})\)</span>. The
<em>bifurcation set</em> <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> is defined as the projection
of the singular set into the space of unfolding parameters</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B} = \{\mathbf{u}  \in \mathcal{S}\}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> i readily obtained
by eliminating the state variables <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span>.</p>
<p>
<p><span class="paragraph">Physical manifestation of catastrophes</span>
Before deriving the classification of all caustics, it is instructive to
attach a physical meaning to the objects defined above. The various
catastrophes generally arise in situations that map from a space of
initial configurations, <em>Lagrangian space</em>, to a space of final
configurations, <em>Eulerian space</em>. The essential variables <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> here take the role of
Lagrangian space coordinates, while the unfolding variables <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> correspond to the Eulerian
space coordinates. The latter usually chart the (up to) <span
class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-dimensional space-time a physical
experiment lives in.</p>
<p>The singularity germs describe the Lagrangian space configuration,
e.g. a lensing or gravitational potential <span
class="math inline">\(\Phi(\mathbf{x})\)</span>. The critical set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> then corresponds the set of
solutions to a governing equation (mapping equation, equation of motion,
…) from this initial configuration, i.e. the set of all possible paths
from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>. This may be, for instance,
the ensemble of light rays bent by a lensing potential, matter moving
through a gravitational potential, or generic solutions to an initial
value problem. The singular set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> then corresponds to the
boundaries of those regions in the Eulerian space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span> where several solutions
coincide; that is, where several Lagrangian positions <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> are mapped to the same final
configuration <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>. The
Lagrangian space is usually inaccessible, so that an experiment does not
observe <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>, but only the bifurcation set
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span>, which is the
projection of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> into the
observed Eulerian space <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>.</p>
<p>These concepts are is nicely illustrated with snapshot of a 2D mesh
simulation for cosmological structure formation; for more details, see
<a href="./research.html">my research page</a>. An observer would
observe the Eulerian space in the right panel, i.e. the density of
particles at the final positions at some time <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. The observer does not a priori know
whence these particles came from, as the Lagrangian space is not
observable. The bifurcation set in Eulerian space is characterised by
(infinite) density spikes. Our knowledge of the simulation allows us to
draw the evolving mesh from Lagrangian space, and correctly identify the
bifurcation set as the set of Eulerian points bounding the
<em>multistream</em> regions where several incoming paths overlap.</p>
<h2 id="the-seven-elementary-catastrophes">The seven elementary
catastrophes</h2>
<p>Having discussed all the needed fundamental notions, I will discuss
the seven elementary catastrophes and their characteristic
geometries.</p>
<h3 id="corank-1-catastrophes-the-cuspoids">Corank-1 catastrophes: the
cuspoids</h3>
<p>We will first discuss the the corank-1 catastrophes, which are known
as the <em>cuspoids</em>, after the archetypical cusp catastrophe
occurring in this family of singularities.</p>
<p>We have already seen above that the universal unfoldings are given in
the form <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = x^n + u_{n-2} x^{n-2} +
\ldots + u_1 x\)</span>. It is thus straightforward to derive the
equilibrium, singular and bifurcation sets and discus their
geometries.</p>
<h4 id="a2-fold-catastrophe">A<sub>2</sub> fold catastrophe</h4>
<p>Some properties of the fold catastrophe <span
class="math inline">\(x^3\)</span> were already discussed above. The
universal unfolding is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{f_{A_2}(x) = x^3 + u x}
\]</span></p>
<p>with a single unfolding parameter <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The equilibrium and singular set are
readily obtained:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{M}_{A_2} = \left\{ (x, u) :  3 x^2 + u = 0 \right\}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S}_{A_2} = \left\{ (x, u) : 6x = 0 \right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>Elimination of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> yields the
bifurcation set</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_{A_2} = \left\{ u: u = 0 \right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>The bifurcation set in this case is just a single point in the
unfolding space. This is exactly what we discussed above regarding the
structural stability of the cubic polynomial: As the unfolding parameter
<span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> is varied through 0, the
qualitative nature changes as the degenerate critical point is unfolded
into a pair of non-degenerate critical points (maximum and minimum).</p>
<h4 id="a3-cusp-catastrophe">A<sub>3</sub> cusp catastrophe</h4>
<p>Next in the list of co-dimension-<span
class="math inline">\(1\)</span> caustics is the <em>cusp</em>
catastrophe <span class="math inline">\(x^4\)</span>. The cusp has
co-dimension <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, and the universal
unfolding is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{f_{A_3}(x) = x^4 + u x^2 + v x}
\]</span></p>
<p>with two unfolding parameters <span
class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span>. The equilibrium and singular set
are given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{M}_{A_3} = \left\{ (x, u, v) :  4 x^3 + 2 u x + v = 0 \right\}
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S}_{A_3} = \left\{ (x, u) : 12 x^2 + 2u = 0\right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>Eliminating <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> yields the
bifurcation set in the unfolding parameters</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_{A_3} = \left\{ (u, v) : 8 u^3 + 37 v^2 =0\right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>The equilibrium set (yellow) and singular set (red) are shown in the
left panel of the figure below. The bifurcation set is the projection
into the space of unfolding parameters <span

<p>The equilibrium and bifurcation set of the cusp catastrophe reveals a
generic geometric property of all the caustics: The equilibrium surface
is a smooth surface in the space <span
class="math inline">\((\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u})\)</span>, but the
bifurcation set is not a smooth line in the unfolding space <span
class="math inline">\((\mathbf{u})\)</span>. More formally, the
equilibrium set is always a manifold, whereas the bifurcation set is
not. In the case of the cusp, <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> is diffeomorphic, but not
homeomorphic, to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^1\)</span>,
meaning that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}\)</span> cannot be
smoothly deformed to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^1\)</span>
without flattening the non-differentiable point at the origin.</p>
<p>As was mentioned above, the equilibrium set typically represent the
physical solutions to a boundary problem, with <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> being the unobservable
Lagrangian space, and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{u}\)</span>
being the observed Eulerian space. For the cusp, we can see that there
are regions of 3 overlapping solutions, which are bounded the by the
cusp point and the fold lines emerging from it. These are known as
<em>multi-image regions</em> in lensing applications, or <em>multistream
regions</em> is cosmological structure formation and are nicely
illustrated in the following physical applications.</p>

<p>The swallowtail catastrophe in particular has attracted attention not
only from scientists, but also in the fine arts. And example is Salvador
Dalí’s last painting, “The swallow’s tail” (1983), which Dalí created in
honour of the aesthetics of Thom’s theory of catastrophes and their
morphogenesis. More recently, engineer and author Allan McRobie has
interpreted catastrophe theory as the theory of “beautifully curved”
surfaces, which appear ubiquitously in the organic world, and are found
to appeal more to the innate human understanding of beauty than the
simple shapes of solid geometry possibly could. An example of this is
shown in the right panel of the figure below, where a woman’s curved
torso is aesthetically forming the equilibrium surface of the
swallowtail catastrophe.</p>

<h3 id="corank-2-catastrophes-the-umbilics">Corank-2 catastrophes: the
umbilics</h3>
<p>The corank-1 catastrophes were trivial to derive from the structural
stability of the canonical <span class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>
singularity. For the corank-2 catastrophes, more work is needed, and we
again follow <a
href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-catastrophe-theory/D5ECA839997CD9C2A247C413E69CD2B8">Saunders
(1980)</a> for the detailed derivation.</p>
<p>To investigate the non-degenerate critical points of corank 2, let us
start the derivation from the 3-jet of a function with two variables
<span class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> such that the 2-jet
identically vanishes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^3(x,y) = (a_1 x + b_1 y)(a_2 x + b_2 y)(a_3 x + b_3 y)
\]</span></p>
<p>Our task now is to find suitable diffeomorphisms to bring this 3-jet
into (one possible choice of) the distinct forms for the canonical
singularities. The proposed factorised form of the 3-jet is particularly
nice, as the 3 corank-2 singularities turn out to correspond to three
possible cases for roots the jet polynomial, namely (i) real distinct
roots, (ii) complex distinct roots and (iii) one pair of repeated real
roots. We now go through these cases and discuss their geometries.</p>
<h4 id="d4-hyperbolic-umbilic">D<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> hyperbolic
umbilic</h4>
<p>Consider first the case of complex roots. Because complex roots of a
real polynomial appear in pairs, we can conclude w.l.o. generality that
<span class="math inline">\((a_3 = \bar{a}_2, b_3 = \bar{b}_2)\)</span>
and write <span class="math inline">\(j^3(x,y) = (a_1 x + b_1
y)\left((\Re(a_2) x + \Re(b_2) y)^2 + (\Im(a_2) x + \Im(b_2) y)^2
\right)\)</span>. Using two linear transformations (diffeomorphisms), we
can write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^3(x,y) \sim (a x + b y)(x^2 + y^2) \sim x^3 + x y^2 \sim x^3 + y^3
\]</span></p>
<p>The first transformation used was <span class="math inline">\((x
\mapsto ax + by, y \mapsto bx -ay)\)</span>, and the second
diffeomorphism was found by writing <span class="math inline">\((x+y)^3
+ (x-y)^3 = 2x^3 + 6xy^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The form <span class="math inline">\(\eta(x,y) = x^3 + x y^2\)</span>
is the one used by <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01077644">Arnol’d
(1972)</a>, and we will see below that it is parallel to the canonical
form of elliptic umbilic. For physical applications, the form <span
class="math inline">\(\eta(x,y) = x^3 + y^3\)</span> is generally found
to be more useful, and we therefore take the canonical form of the form
of the <span class="math inline">\(D_4^+\)</span> singularity to be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{D_4^+: \quad \eta(x,y) = x^3 + y^3}
\]</span></p>
<p>We are now interested in the universal unfolding, which we will find
using <em>Siersma’s trick</em>. One starts by considering a versal
unfolding <span class="math inline">\(g(x,y)\)</span> of the canonical
singularity by adding all possible monomials in <span
class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
g(x, y) = \eta(x,y) + \sum_{i,j} \alpha_{i,j} x^i x^j
\]</span></p>
<p>Clearly, this is not the universal unfolding as several of the added
terms can be eliminated by a suitable diffeomorphism, just as <span
class="math inline">\(x^{n-1}\)</span> was eliminated for the <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span>-singularities above. Consider now an
infinitesimal diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\Psi : \left\{
x \mapsto x + \psi(x,y),  y \mapsto y + \chi(x,y) \right\}\)</span> with
some polynomial functions <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x,y),
\chi(x,y)\)</span>. This infinitesimal diffeomorphism transforms the
canonical singularity to</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\Psi :  \eta(x,y) \mapsto \eta(x,y) + \psi(x,y) \frac{\partial
\eta(x,y)}{\partial x} + \chi(x,y) \frac{\partial \eta(x,y)}{\partial y}
\]</span></p>
<p>This implies that a suitable choice of the functions <span
class="math inline">\(\psi(x,y), \chi(x,y)\)</span> can reproduce any
terms in <span class="math inline">\(g(x,y)\)</span> that are multiples
of either <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial
x}\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial
y}\)</span>. These terms can therefore not be part of the universal
unfolding, and can be eliminated. The remaining terms may or may not be
the terms in the universal unfolding.</p>
<p>This is visually illustrated by arranging all monomials in a triangle
such that any term is a multiple of its upper neighbors. One now draws a
shadow from the terms <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x
\eta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\partial_y \eta\)</span>
to exclude their multiples. For the <span
class="math inline">\(D_4^+\)</span> singularity, these are <span
class="math inline">\(\partial_x \eta\sim x^2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\partial_y \eta\sim y^2\)</span>.</p>

<figcaption>

singularity.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, we find three unshaded terms <span class="math inline">\(x, y,
xy\)</span> which may appear in the universal unfolding. But the <span
class="math inline">\(D_4^+\)</span> catastrophe has codimension 3 (the
least codimension for corank-2 singularities), and we therefore conclude
that we have obtained universal unfolding with these three terms:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{f_{D_4^+}(x) = x^3 + y^3  + w x y - u x - v y}
\]</span></p>
<p>From here on, we can proceed as before. The equilibrium set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{D_4^+}\)</span> of the elliptic
umbilic caustic is given by the two simultaneous equations</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{M}_{D_4^+} = \{ (x, y, u, v, w) : -u+w y+3 x^2 = 0 \qquad -v+w
x+3 y^2=0\}
\]</span></p>
<p>and the singular set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_{D_4^+}\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S}_{D_4^+} =  \{ (x, y, u, v, w) : 36 x y-w^2 = 0 \}
\]</span></p>
<p>Eliminating the essential variables <span
class="math inline">\((x,y)\)</span> yields the bifurcation set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}_{D_4^+}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_{D_4^+} = \{ (u, v, w) : -u^4+8 u^3 w^2-2 u^2 v^2-18 u^2
w^4-24 u v^2 w^2-v^4-18 v^2 w^4+27 w^8=0 \}
\]</span></p>
<p>The bifurcation set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}_{D_4^+}\)</span> is a 2-dimensional
surface in the unfolding space <span
class="math inline">\((u,v,w)\)</span>, and may therefore be readily
visualised. In physical application, the parameter <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> typically corresponds to a time or
other strength parameter, specifying the growth of the caustic. It is
therefore most instructive to also plot a slice of the bifurcation set
for fixed <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, as this is the
configuration that may be observed e.g. in optical experiments at a
given time.</p>

<p>While we have now shown the characteristic geometry of the hyperbolic
umbilic caustic as may be observed in experiments, it is worthwhile to
also investigate the equilibrium set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{D_4^+}\)</span>. Here, this is a
3-dimensional volume. If one again considers a slice for fixed <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> (i.e. physically considers a fixed-time
slice), the 2-dimensional <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{D_4^+}\)</span>-slice may be readily
visualised e.g. by eliminating the state variable <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (i.e. projecting into the space <span
class="math inline">\((y,u,v)\)</span>).</p>

<p>The rotating view of the equilibrium surface beautifully illustrates
the argument brought forward above, namely that the equilibrium and
singular sets of the catastrophes are smooth manifolds, with the
singular structure in the bifurcation sets miraculously arising from
projections “along the line of sight”.</p>

<p>Consider now the case of three real and distinct root, i.e. the
coefficient pairs <span class="math inline">\((a_i, b_i)\)</span> are
distinct. One can then write the 3-jet as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^3(x,y)  \sim (a x + b y) x y \sim (x + y) x y \sim x (x^2 - y^2) \,,

class="math inline">\((x \mapsto x + y, y \mapsto x- y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We thus take the canonical form of the <span

<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>and the nomenclature <span class="math inline">\(D_4^{\pm}\)</span>
in Arnold’s form <span class="math inline">\(x^3 \pm x y^2\)</span> is
evident.</p>
<p>We now again find the universal unfolding Siersma’s trick. The
relevant derivatives are <span class="math inline">\(\partial_x \eta\sim
x^2 - y^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\partial_y \eta \sim
x y\)</span>. While the latter has an obvious place in the diagram, the
former does not. One can, however, use these terms to write <span
class="math inline">\(x^3 = x(x^2 - y^2) + y(yx)\)</span> and similary
for <span class="math inline">\(y^3\)</span>, so that both <span

<p>There are 4 unshaded terms, <span class="math inline">\(x, y,
x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y^2\)</span> left. But the
<span class="math inline">\(D_4^-\)</span> singularity again has
codimension 3, so one further variable must be eliminated. If one
introduces a symmetric unfolding term <span class="math inline">\(x^2 +
y^2\)</span>, one can easily eliminate both <span
class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y^2\)</span> by writing <span
class="math inline">\(2 x^2 = (x^2+y^2) + (x^2-y^2)\)</span> and
similarly for <span class="math inline">\(y^2\)</span>. Note that one
could equivalently use <span class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y^2\)</span> to eliminate the other respectively,
but the symmetric form is generally found more useful. We therefore
write the universal unfolding as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[

<h4 id="d5-parabolic-umbilic">D<sub>5</sub> parabolic umbilic</h4>
<p>The parabolic umbilic corresponds to the case of a pair of repeated
roots. One can write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^3(x,y) \sim (a_1 x + b_1 y)^2(a_3 x + a_3 y) \sim x^2 y
\]</span></p>
<p>The equality of the repeated roots gives an additional constraint
equation, thus raising the codimension to 4. One can show that this
requires one to consider the 4-jet</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^4(x,y) =  x^2 y+ h(x,y)
\]</span></p>
<p>to obtain the canonical form of the singularity. Writing <span
class="math inline">\(h(x,y) = \alpha_1 y^4 + \alpha_2 y^3 x + \alpha_3
y^2 x^2 + \alpha_4 x y^3 + \alpha_5 x^4\)</span>, one now wants to find
a diffeomorphism <span class="math inline">\(\Psi : \left\{ x \mapsto x
+ \psi(x,y),  y \mapsto y + \chi(x,y) \right\}\)</span> that does not
alter the 3-jet to and simplify the 4-jet. It can be shown that one can
choose <span class="math inline">\(\psi(x,y) = -\frac{1}{2} \alpha_2
y^2, \chi(x,y) = -(\alpha_3 y^2 + \alpha_4 x y + \alpha_5 x^2)\)</span>
to obtain <span class="math inline">\(j^4(x,y) \sim x^2 y +
y^4\)</span>, which we take as the canonical form of the <span
class="math inline">\(D_5\)</span> singularity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{D_5: \quad \eta(x,y) = y^4 + x^2 y }
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that a further degeneracy in the 3-jet or the requirement of a
higher term (e.g. <span class="math inline">\(y^4\)</span>) vanishing in
the 4-jet would raise the codimension to 4. The <span
class="math inline">\(D_5\)</span> singularity is therefore the last in
the list of the catastrophes up to codimension 4.</p>
<p>The universal unfolding is again found by considering <span
class="math inline">\(\partial_x \eta \sim x y\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\partial_y \eta \sim x^2 + y^3\)</span>, where the
former has a place in the diagram. One can draw further shadows from
<span class="math inline">\(x^3 = -y^2(xy) + x(x^2 + y^3)\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(y^4 = y (x^2 + y^3) - x(xy)\)</span>.</p>

</figure>
<p>This leaves 5 unshaded terms <span class="math inline">\(x, y, x^2,
y^2, y^3\)</span> of which <span class="math inline">\(y^3\)</span> may
be eliminated from a combination of <span
class="math inline">\(x^2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x^2 +
y^3\)</span>. We therefore take the universal unfolding of the <span
class="math inline">\(D_5\)</span> singularity to be.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\boxed{f_{D_5} = y^4 + x^2 y + w x^2 + t y^2 - u x - v y}
\]</span></p>
<p>The equilibrium set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{D_5}\)</span> is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{M}_{D_5} = \{ (x, y, t, u, v, w): -u + 2 w x + 2 x y=0 \qquad
-v + x^2 + 2 t y + 4 y^3=0 \}
\]</span></p>
<p>and the singular set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{S}_{D_5}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{S}_{D_5} = \{ (x, y, t, u, v, w): 4 t w - 4 x^2 + 4 t y + 24 w
y^2 + 24 y^3=0 \}
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, the bifurcation set <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}_{D_5}\)</span> is obtained as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{B}_{D_5} =  \{ (t, u, v, w): 1889568 u^5 - 524880 u^4 w^2 -
7558272 u^3 v w^2 + 58320 u^3 w^4 + 1259712 u^2 v w^4 + 839808 t u^2 w^5
- 3240 u^2 w^6 - 69984 u v w^6 - 93312 t u w^7 + 90 u w^8 + 1296 v w^8 +
2592 t w^9 - w^10 + 5184 w^11 = 0 \}
\]</span></p>
<p>The geometry of the parabolic umbilic is arguably the most
complicated of all the objects discussed in these notes. Note that the
equilibrium set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{M}_{D_5}\)</span>
is 4-dimensional hypersurface in the 6-dimensional <span
class="math inline">\((\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u})\)</span> and the
bifurcation set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{B}_{D_5}\)</span>
is a 3-dimensional volume in the space of unfolding parameters.
Intuition may be gained by plotting slices of the bifurcation set for
varying <span class="math inline">\((t,u)\)</span>, as in the following
figure</p>
<figure>

class="math inline">\((t,u) = \{(-1,0),(0,1),(-0.8,-0.5)\}\)</span>.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Interestingly, the parabolic umbilic exhibits quite distinct
geometries for different parameter values <span
class="math inline">\((t,u)\)</span>, some of which are typically
displayed in textbooks. More intuition may be gained by plotting the
bifurcation sets for smoothly varying values $(t,u), as done in the
following animation.</p>

origin.

<p>Here, one nicely observes the different configurations which <a
href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Stabilit%C3%A9_structurelle_et_morphog%C3%A9n%C3%A8s.html?id=t7Lbs7x5G9wC&amp;redir_esc=y">Thom
(1972)</a> already described in his very original work on morphogenesis.
As one crosses <span class="math inline">\((1,0)\)</span>, the
<em>beak-to-beak</em> configuration turns into two swallowtails, which
in turn disappear and turn into a <em>dovetail</em> configuration. At
<span class="math inline">\((0, -1)\)</span>, an isolated bifurcation
point at the origin, which grows first into a <em>lisp</em>
configuration and then a <em>hyperbolic umbilic focus</em> of maximal
extend at about <span class="math inline">\((...)\)</span>. The triangle
then shrinks into an <em>elliptic focus</em> which eventually
disappears. A <em>piercing configration</em> then forms around <span
class="math inline">\((-0.2, 0.8)\)</span>, out of which the
<em>beak-to-beak</em> emerges again.</p>
<p>It is, however, difficult to go beyond the shown <span
class="math inline">\((t,u)\)</span> slices and understand the
morphogenesis of the bifurcation set, and even more the equilibrium set,
in the whole unfolding space.</p>

<p>Having discussed the characteristic geometries of the seven
elementary catastrophes, I would like to conclude this section with a
picture of work. Naum Gabo’s intriguing “Linear Construction in Space
No. 2” (1958). The sculpture shows a smooth and intricately curved
structure made solely from organic shapes. An observer sees the
structure as if were projected along their line of sight, and the shapes
that are folding over the projected direction are observed as caustic
points, thus beautifully illustrating the mathematical and physical
concepts we have discussed above.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-the-seven-elementary-catastrophes">Beyond the seven
elementary catastrophes</h2>
<p>Having completed the discussion of the seven elementary caustics, the
reader may be tempted to continue reading into catastrophe theory by
mentioning two interesting properties of higher catastrophes.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have shown in detail how the unfoldings codimension-4
singularities are derived. The very same methods can be applied to
derive the canonical forms and unfoldings of the codimension-5
singularities, which are well known in the literature (e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(x^7\)</span> is known as the <em>wigwam</em>
catastrophe). It is obvious that the corank-1 cuspoids, i.e. the <span
class="math inline">\(x^n\)</span> singularities, form an infinite
family, of which the universal unfoldings are evident. It is also
intuitive that the corank-2 umbilics form an infinite family, even
though the canonical forms and unfoldings are much less clear in this
case. <a
href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01077644">Arnol’d</a>
has demonstrated that these infinite families, along with three
“exceptional” higher-codimension catastrophes, can be classified using
the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams; that is, the catastrophes admit an <em>ADE
classification</em>. This finally motivates the use of the symbols <span
class="math inline">\(A_n\)</span> for the cuspoids and <span
class="math inline">\(D_n\)</span> for the umbilics, which we had left
uncommented above. I will write separate notes on Picard-Lefschetz
theory and the ADE classification and of higher catastrophes soon.</p>
<p>The second curious property of higher-codimension catastrophes can be
introduced by considering a general 4-jet such that the 3-jet
identically vanishes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^4(x,y) \sim (a_1 x + b_1 y)(a_2 x + b_2 y)(a_3 x + b_3 y)(a_4 x + b_4
y)
\]</span></p>
<p>Assuming real and non-repeated roots of the quartic polynomial, the
singularity is of codimension 8. One can now proceed as above to find a
possible canonical form. But if one writes</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
j^4(x,y) \sim x y(a x + b y)(p x + q y) \sim x y(x + y)(s x + t y) \sim
x y(x + y)(x + \lambda y) \,,
\]</span></p>
<p>there remains a free parameter <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> that cannot be absorbed by a
suitable diffeomorphism. One therefore does not obtain a single
canonical form, but a 1-parameter family of castrastrophes that cannot
be transformed into each other through diffeomorphisms. These <em>moduli
spaces</em> are a generic property of higher catastrophes.</p>
